Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.29,0:06:46.00,Main,,0,0,0,,Firstly.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.00,0:06:51.25,Main,,0,0,0,,That sword makes it possible to separate Ms. Class Rep from the Curse Cat.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.25,0:06:55.15,Main,,0,0,0,,That does indeed seem to be the best idea for dealing with the Curse Cat once and for all.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.15,0:06:57.77,Main,,0,0,0,,However, it's precisely because it seems like the best idea
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.77,0:07:02.22,Main,,0,0,0,,that it will likely be the one thing\NMs. Class Rep is most on her guard against.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.22,0:07:04.48,Main,,0,0,0,,I mean, it's an idea that even you were able to think of,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.98,0:07:08.41,Main,,0,0,0,,so don't you think it would've been the first thing she anticipated and took measures against?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.29,0:07:11.91,Main,,0,0,0,,If we're talking hypothetically, yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.40,0:07:16.71,Main,,0,0,0,,However, I'm pretty confident that things will go smoothly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.71,0:07:18.81,Main,,0,0,0,,I have a plan of my own.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.81,0:07:19.77,Main,,0,0,0,,A plan?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.77,0:07:22.24,Main,,0,0,0,,Well, maybe not a plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.24,0:07:23.17,Main,,0,0,0,,It's more of a hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.92,0:07:26.67,Main,,0,0,0,,Hmm?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.67,0:07:29.75,Main,,0,0,0,,Okay. I'll just trust you on that one, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.75,0:07:31.84,Main,,0,0,0,,If you're really okay with that, that is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.84,0:07:34.17,Main,,0,0,0,,I am. Don't make it sound like there's more to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.17,0:07:35.93,Main,,0,0,0,,What were the two other things you wanted to warn me about?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.68,0:07:39.47,Main,,0,0,0,,Actually, scratch the second one.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.47,0:07:41.56,Main,,0,0,0,,There's no point in even mentioning it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.90,0:07:44.06,Main,,0,0,0,,Let me just go straight to the third.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.65,0:07:51.40,Main,,0,0,0,,{\i1}At the time, I had a pretty good idea what Oshino's second warning would've been.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.88,0:07:55.37,Main,,0,0,0,,Here we go with the third and final warning.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.37,0:08:00.04,Main,,0,0,0,,A very important and practical question that needs to be asked, Araragi{*}-kun{*}.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.04,0:08:03.67,Main,,0,0,0,,How are you even going to find Ms. Class Rep?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.67,0:08:05.71,Main,,0,0,0,,She could be hiding anywhere in town.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.67,0:08:07.92,Main,,0,0,0,,Rest assured,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.92,0:08:09.39,Main,,0,0,0,,I have a proper plan for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.39,0:08:12.93,Main,,0,0,0,,One that's more than hopes or wishful thinking,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.93,0:08:15.05,Main,,0,0,0,,so you don't need to bother.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.72,0:08:19.18,Main,,0,0,0,,Anyway, let's each do our own thing from here on out.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.18,0:08:22.60,Main,,0,0,0,,As a specialist, you go look for the Curse Cat using your methods,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.60,0:08:24.35,Main,,0,0,0,,and I'll go look for it using mine.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.77,0:08:28.48,Main,,0,0,0,,Your methods, eh, Araragi{*}-kun{*}?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.48,0:08:31.28,Main,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Something you can't do.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.28,0:08:32.61,Main,,0,0,0,,My ultimate technique. {haha, ultra C. a gymnastic terminology}
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.61,0:08:33.82,Main,,0,0,0,,Oh?
